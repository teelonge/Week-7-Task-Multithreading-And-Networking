Fetching information from the server and uploading image using retrofit

Implementation 1 : Using the api provided on https://pokeapi.co/ built an application that shows a list of all the pokemon characters and their pictures with a nice looking UI.

When a pokemon character is clicked it leads to a page with full details of the character pulled from the appropriate endpoint with all images, move, 
abilities, stats etc showing at different sections.

· Shows appropriate information for appropriate endpoint

· App does not crash when network is turned off

· Ability to set the limit of information I wish to see

Implementation 2:

Using the provided endpoint. The app selects an image from the gallery and uploads said image to the server and returns a success or fail message

· Asks for permission when app is launched

· If permission is denied displays an error message in a textfield

· There is a button to ask again if permission is denied
